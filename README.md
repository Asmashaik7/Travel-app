💡 Why I Built This App

I previously worked at Teletext Holidays, a UK-based travel booking site. That experience inspired me to build something simple in the travel domain.

Later, while attending the Generative AI Mastermind workshop by Outskill, I discovered that apps can be built without writing every single line of code yourself. This motivated me to experiment and create my own travel app — MyTravelBuddyApp.

📖 Learning Journey

I am primarily focused on SQL, Python, and Data Analytics, but I wanted to explore web development as a side interest.

With the help of AI assistants (Claude initially, and mostly Codey/ChatGPT), I was able to:

Understand React, Tailwind CSS, and Netlify deployment from scratch

Fix issues (like the <Router> error in Netlify, resolved by an ESLint ignore comment)

Learn to structure reusable components

Build a responsive app even as a beginner in web development

This was a learning experiment, not my main career path.

🧩 Challenges Faced

ESLint <Router> error during Netlify deployment → fixed by temporarily ignoring with ESLint comment

Free images search – difficult to find matching ones (plan to improve in future versions)

First-time React + Tailwind CSS learning – many errors, but solved with AI guidance

Understanding hosting/deployment on Netlify – took time to figure out build & site settings

🚀 Future Plans

Add more features (search, filters, destination categories)

Improve structure and modernize the design

Replace placeholder/free images with better curated visuals

Enhance SEO & performance
